Attack of the Shapes!

Download the whole repository (the Download Zip button works well) and run the attackOfTheShapes.exe.

To play, click on shapes of the same color and kind (e.g. cube), and they'll disappear. You can deselect a shape by clicking it again.

The slider on the upper left controls the speed at which new shapes appear.

Have fun!
